# hangman
This Repository contains the project created for the programming course "Multimedia Technology" (7th Semester) at the school of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the National Technical University of Athens.

It is a hangman game which receives dictionaries (big sets of words) from openlibrary.com through their Dictionary IDs, then choosing a word randomly and then the game starts. It is played like a somewhat traditional hangman game.

It was developed with the Java programming language and the User Interface was done using the JavaFX framework and with the help of SceneBuilder. The IDE used was VS Code with the "Extension pack for Java".
